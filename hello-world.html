            <div class="boxed"><blockquote class="second"> &ldquo;I am 20 years old and I am in my first year studying interaction design at The Belfast School of Art.
            I love; hand-lettering, the world around us, jesus, travelling, meeting new people, finding cute new coffee shops, the beach, pretty stationary and home decor, taking pictures, chilling to sleeping at last, cups of tea and all the pretty mugs that come with and of course rich tea biscuits.
            
                I have a passion for all things creative and I don't see what I'm doing as work; I LOVE it. I'm always up for a challenge and learning new things (currently html/css), I'm excited for the journey ahead and for what is to come in the future.&rdquo; </div> </blockquote></div>
